The system is an update of the reverse osmosis (RO) control, which is based on Siemens Simatic latest software TIA 16 and hardware of Simatic S7- 1200 or S7 – 1500 or S7 – 300 System.

**Description and function of the new system.**

The upgrade system is designed according to the European standard.

The new system has the following functions, which is extendable for extra functions in the future.

1. Automatic and manual Control and monitor of the system via graphic-colored icons for:

-   Storage Tank level and supply valve,
-   System feed Pumps OFF / On and speed based on the set supply pressure,
-   High pressure pump OFF / On and speed based on the set membrane pressure,
-   Chemical injection pumps,
-   Manual and Automatic sequence operation are integrated,
-   Flushing Pump control,
-   Treated water supply pump control,

1. Text and graphic alarm messages for:

-   Safety chain devices, (Emergency, control voltage, level and pressure limiters…..),
-   Motor protection devices,
-   Micro filter pressure drop limit
