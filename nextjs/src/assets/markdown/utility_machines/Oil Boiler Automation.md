The system is an update of the oil separator control, which is based on Siemens Simatic S7- 1200 or S7 – 1500 or S7 – 300 System with the following functions, which is extendable for extra functions in the future.

**Description and function of the new system.**

The upgrade system is designed according to the European standard for boiler and burner control, Ref. Weishaupt and Saacke burners

The new system has the following functions, which is extendable for extra functions in the future.

1. Automatic and manual Control and monitor of different devices installed on the boiler body and the burner via graphic-colored icons for:

-   Boiler main on/off,
-   Burner start/stop, and firing sequence, (Duel Burners)
-   Oil supply and return valves and actuators,
-   Fuel selection for duel fuel burners,
-   Load regulation, to control the burner firing rate according to the process value,
-   Economizer control (Chimney heat exchanger)

1. Text and graphic alarm messages for:

-   Safety chain devices, (Emergency, control voltage, level and temperature limiters…..),
-   Level protection devices,
-   Temperature protection devices,
-   Pressure protection devices,
-   Burner faults,
-   Exhaust limit temperature,

1. Monitor the process values for:

-   Thermal oil process pressure and temperature,
-   System process level, control and alarm setting threshold,
-   Burner firing rate (Load regulation)
-   Gas and LFO consumption
-   Hydrocarbon detector,
-   Fire detector,
