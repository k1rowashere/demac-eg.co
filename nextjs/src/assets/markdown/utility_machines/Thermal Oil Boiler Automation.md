The system is an update of the thermal oil boiler control, which is based on Siemens Simatic latest software TIA 16 and hardware Simatic S7- 1200 or S7 – 1500 or S7 – 300 System with the following functions, which is extendable for extra functions in the future.

**Description and function of the new system.**

The upgrade system is designed according to the European standard for boiler and burner control, Ref. Weishaupt and Saacke burners

The new system has the following functions, which is extendable for extra functions in the future.

1. Automatic and manual Control and monitor of different devices installed on the boiler body and the burner via graphic-colored icons

-   Boiler main on/off,
-   Burner start/stop, and firing sequence,
-   Thermal oil circulation pumps, including pumps change over,
-   Fuel selection for duel fuel burners,
-   Load regulation, to control the burner firing rate according to the process value,
-   Economizer control (Chimney heat exchanger)

1. Text and graphic alarm messages.

-   Safety chain devices, (Emergency, control voltage, level and temperature limiters…..),
-   Oil Flow protection devices
-   Motor protection devices,
-   Burner faults,
-   Exhaust limit temperature,
-   Dry run of expansion tank

1. Monitor the process values, like

-   Thermal oil supply and return temperature
-   Burner firing rate (Load regulation)
-   Flue gas temperature
-   Gas and LFO consumption

1. Service bypass functions of oil flow protection sensors for the cold startup
1. Real time and historical trends
1. Operation hours and flow counters
1. Boiler sequencer
