## Grain silos dryer control

Based on Siemens Simatic latest software TIA 16 and hardware of Simatic S7- 1200 or S7 – 1500 or S7 – 300 System.

The upgrade system is to monitor and control the operation of machine components.

**Description and function of the new system.**

1. Automatic and manual Control and monitor of the system via graphic-colored icons for:
    - Intake air blower fan control,
    - Intake air damper servo motor control,
    - Main compressor control for cooling down the air via exchangeraccording to the temperature,
    - 2nd compressor control for high demand,
    - Heating up station in case of low ambient temperature.
  
2. Text and graphic alarm messages for:
   - Safety chain devices, (Emergency, control voltage, … ),
   - Blower motor protection devices,
   - Servo position for dampers and valves,
   - Compressors safety devices, (Oil level, overheating, differential pressure, … ),
   - Air temperature and humidity limits.

3. Monitor the process values for:
   - Air temperature,
   - Air humidity,
   - Actual remain time for process,
   - Setpoint release and alarms threshold.

4. Real time and historical trends.
5. Operation hours and flow counters.
6. Remote monitor and control.
