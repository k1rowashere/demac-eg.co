The system is an update of the 
## Stenter (finishing machine) control

_Based on Siemens Simatic latest software TIA 16 and hardware of Simatic S7- 1200 or S7 – 1500 or S7 – 300 System._

The upgrade system is to monitor and control the operation of machine components.

The new system has the following functions, which is extendable for extra functions in the future.

**Description and function of the new system.**

1. Monitor and control of Fabric drives (Status, operation, and speed control),
2. Monitor and control of fabric Over feed and tension control,
3. Monitor and control of Circulation fans, cool zone and exhaust drives (Status, operation and speed),
4. Monitoring and control of dryer temperature including PID control, no need of external temperature controllers.
5. Monitor and control fabric width, with high intelligent protection software, the current width measuring devices will be replaced by new system, which is compatible to the new software and connected via profibus – DP communication protocol.
6. Monitoring of machine different safety devices
7. Monitor and control for additional functions i.e. in feed, Lubrication, screen cleaning, Selvedge trimmers and chain tension control,
8. Log measurements for production quantity and consumption of electricity, m/c run and stop time (measuring devices are required to be exist)
9. Auto pilot and automatic machine speed control for fabric drying and heat fixation via Pyrometers),
10. Auto pilot for exhaust moisture control, via air humidity sensor.
11. Recipes for different materials settings, which can be downloaded directly to the machine, and can be uploaded from the machine and saved on the PC
12. Alarms and diagnostic screen for trouble shooting assistant.
13. Remote control and assistant for software modifications and diagnoses,
14. Additional software, for the exit panel, in order to control the following

    - Machine speed
    - Exit drives overfeed
    - Monitor machine productivity
    - Width monitor and control of dryer end and machine exit spindles

15. The new PLC and software are extendable to integrate additional functions in future.
