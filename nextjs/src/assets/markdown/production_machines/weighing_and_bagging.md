## Weighting and Bagging Control

Based on Siemens Simatic latest software TIA 16 and hardware of Simatic S7- 1200 or S7 – 1500 or S7 – 300 System.

**Description and function of the new system.**

The upgrade system is to monitor and control the operation of machine components.

The new system has the following functions, which is extendable for extra functions in the future.

1. Automatic and manual Control and monitor of the weighing sequence via a graphical user interface:
   - Intake gate control,
   - Intake grains storage silo level control,
   - Calibration and tar function for load cells,
   - Control gate to achieve the desired weight via gross and dribble mechanism,
   - Discharge gate control for the confirmed weighing quantities,
   - Bag clamp control.
2. Text and graphic alarm messages for:
    - Safety chain devices, (Emergency, control voltage, air supply ….),
    - Over and under weighing limits,
    - Gates position,
    - Storage silos level.
3. Monitor the process values for:
   - Load cell calibration and tar weight,
   - Actual weight in different phases,
   - Actual remain time for process.
4. Real time and historical trends.
5. Batch report, including number of under, over and in range bags.
6. Recipe (Archive) for different material settings.
7. Remote monitor and control.
