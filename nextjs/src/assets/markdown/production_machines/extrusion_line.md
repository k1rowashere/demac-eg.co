Based on Siemens Simatic latest software TIA 16 and hardware of Simatic S7- 1200 or S7 – 1500 or S7 – 300 System.

The upgrade system is to monitor and control the operation of machine components.

**The new system has the following functions, which is extendable for extra functions in the future.**


1. Automatic and manual Control and monitor of the system via graphic-colored icons for:
	- Extruder drive (Status, operation, and speed control),
	- Zones temperature (heating and cooling) including PID control, no need of external temperature controllers.
	- Additives storage tank levels,
	- Additional side feeders (Status, operation, and speed control),
	- Granulator process control
	- Conveyor control
2. Text and graphic alarm messages for:
	- Safety chain devices, (Emergency, control voltage, water supply, compressed air ….),
	- Zones over and under temperature,
	- Line over and under pressure limits,
	- Motors status and protection,
3. Monitor the process values for:
	- Material pressure and temperature,
	- Main scree and side feeders actual speed,
	- Actual remain time for process,
	- Setpoint release and alarms threshold,
4. Real time and historical trends,
5. Recipe (Archive) for different material settings,
6. Remote monitor and control,
